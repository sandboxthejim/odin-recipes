    <ol>
        <li>Cut 300g chicken into bite-size pieces: Leave a little skin/fat on for extra crispiness.</li>
        <li>Marinade the chicken: Add the 5g grated ginger, 2 cloves of crushed garlic, 3 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp cooking sake to a bowl and mix until combined. Add the chicken, coat well, and allow to marinade for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the potato starch: Drain any excess liquid from the chicken and add 1/4 cup katakuriko potato starch. Mix until the pieces are fully coated.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken: Heat some cooking oil in a pan to around 180Â°C and test the temperature by dropping in some flour (if it sizzles on impact, the oil is hot enough). Fry 3-4 pieces at a time for 3-4 minutes until they are deep golden brown colour, then remove and allow to drain on a wire rack or kitchen roll.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Serve hot or cold with some lemon wedges and a squeeze of Japanese mayonnaise.</li>
