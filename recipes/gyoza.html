    <ul>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <li>200g cabbage</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 spring onion</li>
    <li>30 gyoza wrappers</li>
    <li>150g minced pork meat</li>
    <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>2cm ginger (optional)</li>
    <strong>dipping sauce</strong>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tsp la-yu chilli oil(optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the cabbage leaves: Begin by boiling a few cabbage leaves in water until they are soft, then drain them well and slice up into small pieces. Finely slice the 2 garlic cloves , the 1 spring onions and the 2cm ginger.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dumpling fillings: Add your sliced vegetables and the 150g minced pork meat to a bowl, then mix well with the 1 tsp sesame oil and the 1 tsp soy sauce. Try to use an equal amount of pork as your combined vegetables. Put to one side for a short while to marinate and allow the flavours to infuse.</li>
        <li>Make the gyoza dumplings: Now we can start making the actual gyoza. With a gyoza skin in the palm of one hand, spoon a small amount of the mix into the centre of the skin. No need to overfill here, simply add an amount approximate to a teaspoonâ€™s worth. Dip your finger in some water and moisten the edge of the skin to make it easy to seal</li>
        <li>Fold the filled gyoza skin in half and pinch at the top to seal it: Now start folding over the skin on the side facing you and pleating it together to achieve an effect like a folding fan when it is open. The goal is to achieve a sealed wrap which has the pleated texture on one side, but is flat on the reverse side.</li>
        <li>Cook the gyoza dumplings: When you have made as many as you need, heat up a little cooking oil in a pan and gently place the gyoza in it with the flat side facing down. Cook on a high heat until the bottom of the gyoza become crispy and golden.</li>
        <li>team the gyoza dumplings: To finish cooking the gyoza, add a small cup of water to the pan so that the gyoza are half submerged. Place a lid on top of the pan and leave the heat on medium-high.</li>
        <li>Make the gyoza crispy: Allow the gyoza to steam until the water has evaporated, then leave them cooking on the bottom a little longer to make sure that they become crispy and delicious.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Serve the gyoza on a plate with the crispy side facing up and use a combination of 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp rice vinegar and 1 tsp La-Yu Chilli Oil to make a dipping sauce. Alternatively, you can skip this and use a ready made gyoza sauce.</li>
    </ol>
